# Boba Buddies

Boba Buddies is an Angular project built during HackGSU Fall 2019. The aim of the project was to create a new PoS system for restaurants. This new system would allow customers to see their order progress in stages, similar to a pizza tracker.

## Technologies 

The core of the app was based on the NCR Silver API. We created orders from a tablet loaded with an app that connected to the NCR API. Orders were sent to the API and then received via our Boba Buddies app.

The Boba Buddies app took advantage of Angular routing and had two routes: kitchen and customer. Each route acted as a screen for the two parties that would interact with the app through a GUI. Orders received from the physical tablet were sent to the kitchen screen where the cooks could click "next" which would move the order to the next stage. The customer screen would reflect the changes every time the cook clicks "next."

## Prizes

Boba Buddies won the category of [Best Use of Angular.](https://devpost.com/software/boba-buddies)
